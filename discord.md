## Getting Started

Presently, new users are only invited by a current Member (Ring 2 or above) of our guild. In the future, there will be an opportunity to apply to join through Membership Screening (Discord native feature coming 2021?).

Read the rest of this section so that you are familiar with how our guild works.

### Guild Rules

These rules can also be viewed in #rules in our Discord guild.

**Prelude: If you need to appeal any moderation punishments (demotions/kicks/bans), please reach out to any member from the Moderation Team.**

**Please report any rule violations and reach out for help to the moderation team (members above). Because rule violations differ in severity, there is no consistent procedure to determine the severity and nature of actions decided by the moderation team. Please appeal if any moderation actions are unjustified.**

**Rule 1: Follow Discord's Community Guidelines (https://discordapp.com/guidelines).** Keep in mind that some guidelines have heavier weight than others (see Rule 1.5 for more).

**Rule 1.5: Do not do anything (like promoting offensively racist/"alt-right"/threatening content in a good light) that can get our guild and its members in trouble with Discord Trust and Safety.** Discord Trust and Safety are notorious among its well-informed users for mass banning users from the entire service who are residing in guild(s) who fail to enforce parts of the Community Guidelines, even when said users are not active in that/these guild(s). They especially pay attention to racist and "alt-right" content. This means that this content is especially not welcome here. Violations for this rule are taken much more seriously than any other rule listed here.

**Rule 2: Stay good towards each other.** In other words, don't create toxicity or trouble, and don't treat others the way you don't want to be treated. Keep in mind that banter towards someone else is okay as long as they are cool with it. It's worth noting that some users (including you) may have different perspectives and mannerisms, but it's best not to follow through them if they cause issues.

**Rule 3: Try to keep topic-specific conversations in topic-specific channels. Check #org-list to make sure a topic is not preferred to be in a set of channel(s).** For now, depending on the topic, dropping a few things in general that could be elsewhere is okay as long as it's not annoying to people who are not opt-in to see certain topics. We aren't a high traffic guild, so this rule isn't enforced heavily, but if you are asked to take a conversation to the appropriate channel(s), please do so.

**To be a part of this community, you must be Ring 3. See below for more.**

**A brief explanation of the Ring System**:
The Ring System recognizes active members and creates a safety moat for our guild. Usually, promotions come from active guild activity, while demotions (Ring Decay) come from extremely long inactivity.

Hierarchy:

- Ring 1 - Moderation Team (self explanatory)

- Ring 2 - Member (typically consecutive 4 months of frequent activity, at a minimum)

- Ring 3 - New Member (must have this to gain access to usable channels)

You can get Ring 3 by being invited by an existing member, or be accepted through an application process coming soon (tm). Updates on this process will be posted in #pr.

If you joined after Oct 2020 and fail to get Ring 3 after a while, then a @Ring 1 will reach out to you and make sure you're in the right place.

### Server Layout and Channel Visibility

There's a handful of channels on our server, with more to come. The server tries to reduce as much channel visibility as you can, so that the channels that you only care about come into view.

Anyone who is new and joins the server can only see #rules and #pr.

Once you get Ring 3, you can see the channels listed as follows:

```markdown
ricebear-org.github.io

📘 INFO
|
|-----#rules
|-----#announcements
|-----#org-list <----------- Read here to see how to join a channel that has a restricted topic you want to talk about.

|-----#nsfw

🎤 Main Voice

|-----Lobby
|-----(Some channels here...)

[If you join an org, channels will be located here.]

📣 PR

|-----#pr
```

### Join Organizations to Access More Channels

Once you are Ring 3, you can gain access to more channels through joining organizations (see next section) and Ring System promotions. In #org-list, you can click the appropriate emoji reaction on the message to join/leave a public organization. Joining a private organization requires permission from the listed organization manager.

If you have an idea/request for an appropriate public organization/channel, send it to a Ring 1 member.

### User Roles and Perks

Refer to this link [here](#user-groups-rings-and-perks-1) for more details about User Roles and their perks.

### Recommended Applications/Apps to Install

Long time members have come to a general consensus as to what programs to use for certain inter-user tasks. As a new user, it's highly recommended to install these applications/apps for the best experience.

## Supported Discord Clients/Mods

**Only official clients (Stable, PTB, Canary) without mods (this means no custom CSS injection) are tested and supported.** Use unofficial clients/mods (Ripcord, BetterDiscord, BandagedBD, BeautifulDiscord, Powercord, cordless, Discline, discord-term, Glasscord, Lightcord, etc) [at your own risk](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25214777).

## Voice Channels

All voice channels use the latest Opus 1.3 codec with (presumably) CBR, usually at the highest bitrate possible. While all usable voice channels have ample bitrate for music playback, only bots can play music using a stereo output without voice tuning. Everyone else is limited to mono output, with voice tuning (negatively impacts sound quality no matter the bitrate). Alternatively, you can use Spotify's Listen Along feature, which integrates into Discord and only requires a Spotify connection on your Discord account, but only music listening can be done when the feature is used.

In most channels, the voice channel's server region is set to Auto, meaning the server region selected is the lowest ping for the voice channel's first participant. Ring 1 users are able to set a specific voice server region for a voice channel using `/edit_vc_region`. Take a look at this [Discord support article](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060570993-Voice-Regions-Update) for more information on this topic.

The channel name format is as follows: NAME [R]

- NAME -> Either a channel number and/or a special name for this channel.

- R -> Voice server region surrounded by square brackets. Usually set to Auto.

This channel name format may not be present in voice channels outside Main Voice.

## User Roles and Perks

### Ring System

In ricebear, each user has a certain Ring (status) level, which ranges from 5 (lowest status) to 1 (highest status). The lower Ring a user is, the higher rank the user is. To advance in the hierarchy, just be active in the community without causing a lot of trouble and promotions will follow. In cases of community mergers where ricebear continues to maintain this system, users from their prior community may obtain equivalent Ring status from their prior community status, if applicable.

The Ring System recognizes active members and creates a safety moat for our guild. Usually, promotions come from active guild activity, while demotions (Ring Decay) come from extremely long inactivity.

**Ring System hierarchy**:

- Ring 1 - Moderation Team (self explanatory)

- Ring 2 - Member (typically consecutive 4 months of frequent activity, at a minimum)

- Ring 3 - New Member (must have this to gain access to usable channels)

### Perk Comparison Table

In this table, ✔ and ❌ are generally used to show perks User Roles have and don't have. Any of these perks may be revoked or changed at any time, either in the User Group level (table will be updated in this case) or on a single user basis. This is not a comprehensive list of every single permission enabled/disabled on Discord; just the key permissions. Perks may change within Organization channels; these changes aren't listed here.

Notes:

1 - You can send a request to Ring 1 to create a custom org/channel.

### Ring Promotion/Demotion Guide

Only for Ring 1-2 users. Use `/ring add` to promote users to a Ring status, and `/ring remove` to demote users from a Ring status. When moving users to different Rings, add the new Ring status, and then remove the old Ring status.

### Other Roles

There are also **self and organization** roles. Organizations with their own role can have dedicated text/voice channels that only their members can join. These roles, listed on #org-list, can be joined by Ring 3 (and above) members through #org-list reactions. Publically available roles are colored orange, private organization roles are colored yellow, and inactive organization roles are colored dark orange.

**Bot** and **3rd Party Bot** (and related) roles are reserved for bots only.

Roles and their functions can change at any time. Any major changes will be announced to the guild.

## Guild Bots

Currently, the ricebear@Discord gulid has the following bots: 

- AquaBot (formerly known as Red-v3-ricebear). This bot has multiple functions; type `.help` or `/` to see its commands.

- Mudae. This is a 3rd-party bot not hosted by ricebear. Its main function is a gacha game, accessable by members with Mudae Access.

- The following 3rd-party music bots: Hydra, Rythm, and Rythm 2.

Before requesting a separate bot to join the guild, try looking for an [equivalent cog on index.discord.red](https://index.discord.red).

For a bot to be eligible to join, all of these following requirements must be met to be available on main-text channels:

- They must not be a part of [Bot Labs, which is owned by Bluestacks](https://botlabs.gg/).
- They must have a useful purpose.
- They must be self hostable and open source.
- They must be configurable to not store excessive private data and send anonymized telemetry to a non-ricebear owned server. Having no telemetry is a plus. Requested bots that require monitoring user activity when they have no business in doing so will not be accepted for any reason.

For organization and voice channels, all of these following requirements must be met:

- They must not be a part of [Bot Labs, which is owned by Bluestacks](https://botlabs.gg/).
- They must have a useful purpose.

Once they are eligible to join, Ring 1 members will decide whether or not to add the requested bot in the future.
