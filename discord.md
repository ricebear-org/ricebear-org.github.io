## Getting Started

Presently, new users are only invited by a current Member+ (Ring 2 or above) of our guild. In the future, there will be an opportunity to apply to join through Membership Screening (coming 2021).

Upon joining, new users will start at Ring 5 (this doesn't have a dedicated role) unless they have a different Ring status upon joining.

Read the rest of this section so that you are familiar with how our guild works.

### Guild Rules

These rules can also be viewed in #rules in our Discord guild.

**Prelude: If you need to appeal any moderation punishments (demotions/kicks/bans), please reach out to any member from the Moderation Team.**

**Please report any rule violations and reach out for help to the moderation team (members above). Because rule violations differ in severity, there is no consistent procedure to determine the severity and nature of actions decided by the moderation team. Please appeal if any moderation actions are unjustified.**

**Rule 1: Do not break Discord's Community Guidelines (https://discordapp.com/guidelines).** They apply to ALL Discord guilds, not just ours; if you've been in a public community guild (server), these should be familiar to you. If not, please review and understand them.

**Rule 1.5: Do not do anything (like promoting offensively racist/"alt-right"/threatening content in a good light) that can get our guild and its members in trouble with Discord Trust and Safety.** Discord Trust and Safety are notorious among its well-informed users for mass banning users from the entire service who are residing in guild(s) who fail to enforce parts of the Community Guidelines, even when said users are not active in that/these guild(s). They especially pay attention to racist and "alt-right" content. This means that this content is especially not welcome here. Violations for this rule are taken much more seriously than any other rule listed here.

**Rule 2: Stay good towards each other.** In other words, don't create toxicity or trouble, and don't treat others the way you don't want to be treated. Keep in mind that banter towards someone else is okay as long as they are cool with it. It's worth noting that some users (including you) may have different perspectives and mannerisms, but it's best not to follow through them if they cause issues.

**Rule 3: Try to keep topic-specific conversations in topic-specific channels. Check #org-list to make sure a topic is not restricted to a set of channel(s).** For now, depending on the topic, dropping a few things in general that could be elsewhere is okay as long as it's not annoying to people who are not opt-in to see certain topics. We aren't a high traffic guild, so this rule isn't enforced heavily, but if you are asked to take a conversation to the appropriate channel(s), please do so.

**To be a part of this community, you must be recognized as a Ring 4 in our Ring System. See the post below for more.**

**A brief explanation of the Ring System**:
The Ring System establishes a way to identify active members, as well as creating a safety moat for ourselves. New users start at Ring 5 (Guest), and can work their way up to Ring 2 (Member+). Promotions are made through being active in our community, without causing trouble often.

**Slow, yet significant changes are under way. This hierarchy may update in the near future.**

Hierarchy:

- Ring 1 - Moderation Team (self explanatory)

- Ring 2 - Member+ (must be active for "quite some time", have an opportunity to join Ring 1, if desired)

- Ring 3 - Member (typically consecutive 4 months of frequent activity, at a minimum)

- Ring 4 - Prospective Member (must have this to gain access to usable channels)

- Ring 5 - Guest (cannot access any usable channels, may be kicked from the server if self-action is not taken to join our community)

To see usable channels and participate in our community, you must have Ring 4 (Prospective Member), at a minimum. You can get this by:
 - having an invite (endorsement) from an existing Member+ (Ring 2 or above).
 - being accepted through member verification. This process will open during specific periods where users who may not have solid connections from in our community can apply to join. Any relevant notifications regarding  this will be posted in #pr.

If a Ring 5 (who joined after Oct 2020) fails to do this within 2 weeks, they may be contacted by the moderation team and/or be kicked from our guild.

### Server Layout and Channel Visibility

There's a handful of channels on our server, with more to come. The server tries to reduce as much channel visibility as you can, so that the channels that you only care about come into view.

Anyone who is new and joins the server is by default a Ring 5 user (role-less). They can only view a tiny subset of channels listed below:

```markdown
ricebear-org.github.io

📘 INFO
|
|-----#rules

📣 PR
|
|-----#pr
```

You'll need to be Ring 4 or above to gain access to more channels. The default visibility and layout is as follows:

```markdown
ricebear-org.github.io

📘 INFO
|
|-----#rules
|-----#announcements
|-----#org-list <----------- Please read here to see how to join a channel that has a restricted topic you want to talk about.

💬 main-text
|
|-----#general
|-----#nsfw

🎤 Main Voice
|
|-----Ch.1L / AFK
|-----Ch.1S
|-----Ch.2S
|-----Ch.1X
|-----Ch.2X
|-----Ch.1XX

[If you join an org, channels will be located here.]

📣 PR
|
|-----#pr
```

If you aren't an active Supporter yet, you can't join the [X/XX channels](#any-channel-with-x-suffix) without being moved in by [an active Supporter](#ricebear-supporter).

You can gain access to more channels through joining organizations (see next section) and Ring System promotions.

### Join Organizations

Once you become Ring 4, you can gain access to more topic-specific channels by joining organizations, which are listed under #org-list. If the organization is joinable, feel free to join it by clicking the appropriate emoji reaction in #org-text.

1. Check #org-list to see if the organization is joinable.

2. If the organization is joinable, you can react with the appropriate emoji shown under the listing message.

3. You should now see the appropriate channels.

To remove your membership from an organization, you can remove your reaction under the same listing message in #org-list.

If you have an idea/request for an organization/channel, send it to a Ring 1 member. However, if the organization/channel requires restrictions on who can join (besides being at least Ring 4, the base restriction on almost every channel), the organization/channel won't be created unless you are an active Supporter. Any idea/request that is a direct result in a rule violation will be rejected, no matter if you are a Supporter or not. See the [ricebear Supporter](#ricebear-supporter) section for more.

### User Roles and Perks

Refer to this link [here](#user-groups-rings-and-perks-1) for more details about User Roles and their perks.

### Recommended Applications/Apps to Install

Ring 1-3 users in this guild have come to a general consensus as to what programs to use for certain inter-user tasks. As a new user, it's highly recommended to install these applications/apps for the best experience.

## Supported Discord Clients/Mods

Only official clients (Stable, PTB, Canary) without mods (this means no custom CSS injection) are supported. Use unofficial clients/mods (Ripcord, BetterDiscord, BandagedBD, BeautifulDiscord, Powercord, cordless, Discline, discord-term, Glasscord, Lightcord, etc) [at your own risk](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25214777).

## Voice Channel Info

Descriptions about each voice channel type at ricebear@Discord. These prefixes apply to voice channels that are in either the Main Voice or the Org Voice categories. This naming scheme may not apply in other categories. The channel type naming has been inherited from our TeamSpeak server.

Our voice server is currently set to the us-west GCP region. This means that you can either be connected to a server in Oregon or California, USA.

### Any channel with S suffix

Originally designated for music playing, these channels now make up the main portion of the voice channels. The S stands for Studio.

The bitrate and codec is 96 kbps Opus 1.3 CBR.

### Any channel with X suffix

Alternative to the S channels. While active Supporters can only join these channels, everyone else can join by being moved into it by a Supporter. These channels use as much data as an internet radio. Users with extremely weak connections should not use these channels. **Only Discord bot voice output (can use the Opus Music tune and stereo audio output) will take advantage of this bitrate, due to the fact that Discord user clients are restricted to the Opus Voice tune and mono audio output.** The X stands for Xtreme.

The bitrate and codec is 128 kbps Opus 1.3 CBR.

### Any channel with XX suffix

Alternative to the S channels. While active Supporters can only join these channels, everyone else can join by being moved into it by a Supporter. These channels use as much data as an internet radio. Users with extremely weak connections should not use these channels. **Only Discord bot voice output (can use the Opus Music tune and stereo audio output) will take advantage of this bitrate, due to the fact that Discord user clients are restricted to the Opus Voice tune and mono audio output.**

The bitrate and codec is 256 kbps Opus 1.3 CBR.

### Any channel with V suffix

These channels can have bitrates modified by their channel owners at any time. The V stands for Variable.

### Any channel with P suffix

These channels are restricted (private). Only allowed users are able to join the channels they are allowed to join. The allowed users are controlled by the Channel Owners in their respective channels. Restricted (private) channel creation is currently exclusive to Supporters. The P stands for Private.

### Any channel with E suffix

These channels are dedicated to special events in our guild. Some of these channels have allowlists that work like the ones found in the channels with a P suffix. The E stands for Event.

### Any channel with L suffix

These are designated AFK/Lobby channels. It's not possible to talk in them. After an hour of inactivity, you will be automatically moved there. The L stands for Lobby.

## User Roles and Perks

### Ring System

In ricebear, each user has a certain Ring (status) level, which ranges from 5 (lowest status) to 1 (highest status). The lower Ring a user is, the higher rank the user is. To advance in the hierarchy, just be active in the community without causing a lot of trouble and promotions will follow. In cases of community mergers where ricebear continues to maintain this system, users from their prior community may obtain equivalent Ring status from their prior community status, if applicable.

The Ring system is built to help users recognize active users. Ring status is retained and recognized throughout all of ricebear.

Slow, yet significant changes are under way to the Ring System. This hierarchy may update in the near future.

**Descriptions for each Ring**:

- Ring 5: A non-member of ricebear. Also known as a Guest of ricebear.

- Ring 4: An active prospective member of ricebear. This means that they want to be a member, but they aren't a member yet. With time and love, they will eventually become a member of ricebear (usually 4+ consecutive months of activity).

- Ring 3: A full-fledged active member of ricebear.

- Ring 2: An active member of ricebear who has been here for a while.

- Ring 1: Trusted members with ban/kick privileges.

- Ring 0: Not considered a part of the Ring System. Indicates users with admin privileges.

### Perk Comparison Table

In this table, ✔ and ❌ are generally used to show perks User Roles have and don't have. Any of these perks may be revoked or changed at any time, either in the User Group level (table will be updated in this case) or on a single user basis. This is not a comprehensive list of every single permission enabled/disabled on Discord; just the key permissions. Perks may change within Organization channels; these changes aren't listed here.

**Kicking/banning users are restricted to the Moderation Team. To be eligible to join, you must be a Ring 2 and pass a brief training session.**

Notes:

1 - You can request the Moderation Team to create a public org/channel (joinable in #org-text). Private org/channels with restricted access require being an active Supporter.

### Other Roles

There are also **self and organization** roles. Organizations with their own role can have dedicated text/voice channels that only their members can join. These roles, listed on #org-list, can be joined by Ring 4 (and above) members through #org-text reactions. Publically available roles are colored orange, private organization roles are colored yellow, and inactive organization roles are colored dark orange.

**Bot** and **3rd Party Bot** (and related) roles are reserved for bots only.

Roles and their functions can change at any time. Any major changes will be announced to the guild.

## ricebear Supporter

The ricebear Server (not the same as the Discord guild) used to host our own bots from costs money to run. We host our own instances of bots whenever possible to keep our Discord guild stable and safe. We also want to improve our server's functionality through Discord Boosting. To keep the server online and with enhanced functionality, we rely on monetary donations. Giving a donation to ricebear helps the ricebear Server and our guild continue to thrive and live into the near future, and also grants you special (time-limited) perks within the guild. Contact the Moderation Team in the guild for details on how to donate. We appreciate your support!

### Restricted Channel/Organization Guide

This functionality requires Supporter, or at least Ring 2.

To activate your restricted organization, just simply send the following details to haradatakumi_yo#0765:

1. Channel name(s) and purpose(s)

2. Block everyone from being moved out of your restricted voice channel (evaluated on a case by case basis and may not be provided)

3. Voice channel bitrates

4. [Tier 2-3 Only] Organization name and purpose

~~You can configure users who can join your restricted channels using the r;cc~~ (cc commands are discontinued), and who are in your restricted organization (thus changing access to the restricted organization's channels) with the `/role` commands (only for Supporter Tier 2-3, Ring 2 or above). After typing a slash, Discord will show subcommands that you can use (add/remove members, etc). To change any of the other details you've provided, contact a Ring 1 member.

Your restricted organization will be located either alphabetically with other organizations or within the proper category along with other restricted channels.

Ring 1 members can bypass the restricted channel's/organization's allowlist for admin purposes.

## Guild Bots

Currently, the ricebear@Discord gulid has the following bots: 

- AquaBot (formerly known as Red-v3-ricebear). This bot has multiple functions; type `.help` or `/` to see its commands.

- Mudae. This is a 3rd-party bot not hosted by ricebear. Its main function is a gacha game, accessable by members with Mudae Access.

- The following 3rd-party music bots: FredBoat, Hydra, Rythm, and Rythm 2.

Before requesting a separate bot to join the guild, try looking for an [equivalent cog on index.discord.red](https://index.discord.red).

For a bot to be eligible to join, all of these following requirements must be met to be available on main-text channels:

- They must have a useful purpose.
- They must be self hostable and open source.
- They must be configurable to not store excessive private data and send anonymized telemetry to a non-ricebear owned server. Having no telemetry is a plus. Requested bots that require monitoring user activity when they have no business in doing so will not be accepted for any reason.

For organization and voice channels, the only requirement is to be a useful bot.

Once they are eligible to join, Ring 1 members will decide whether or not to add the requested bot in the future.
