## Server Rules

These rules can also be viewed in `#info` in our Discord server.

- Follow [Discord's Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) as they apply to this server, as it does in every other Discord server. It explicitly states what's not good to post in Discord.

- Stay good towards each other.

### Enforcement & Appeal

Higher ranked users reserve the privilege to moderate users (timeout, kick, ban, etc.) who don't follow these rules (there are no specific procedures we follow). To **appeal** against any moderation actions, **reach out to any Server Admin or Member through any method possible**.

## Server Layout and Channel Visibility

There's a handful of channels in our server; any channels that can be viewed by all members appear by default. You can utilize `Browse Channels` located below the server name to show/hide channels at any time. If any of the Circles in `#circle-list` interest you, reach out to their managers to gain access to their channel(s).

By default, anyone can see the channels listed below:

```markdown

```

## Supported Discord Clients/Mods

**Only official clients (Discord Stable, PTB, Canary) without mods (such as custom CSS injection, enrolling yourself in experiments you shouldn't use, etc) are tested and supported.** Use unofficial clients/mods [at your own risk](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25214777).

## Voice Channels

In Main Voice, voice channels dynamically show up depending on server activity. If `Lobby` is the only channel in Main Voice, join `Lobby`, and then a talkable voice channel will appear below. `Lobby` is the designated AFK channel; inactive voice channel participants are moved there after 1 hour of inactivity.

All voice channels use the highest bitrate available on the server. However, the only way to output audio quality acceptable for music listening is by using bots or Go Live streaming. Alternatively, you can use the [Listen to Spotify](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003966072-Listening-Along-with-Spotify) feature.

Normally, voice channels have their region overrides set to Auto.

All voice channels in Main Voice (except Lobby) can be modified by Members to adjust almost all voice channel settings like name, visibility, and the voice region override.

## User Roles and Perks

### Main Roles

Like any server, there's a main role hierarchy that recognizes active members and creates a safety moat. *Usually*, to advance in the hierarchy, just be positively active in the community. Being inactive may result in a demotion. If applicable, users from communities that merged with ricebear may obtain equivalent roles from their prior community standing.

**Role Hierarchy**:

- Server Admin

- Member (*typically* consecutive 4 months of frequent activity, at a minimum)

- Non-Member (represented by @everyone)

### Permissions Comparison Table

In this table, ✔ and ❌ are generally used to show permissions User Roles have and don't have. Any of these permissions may change at any time, either in the User Group level (table will be updated in this case) or on a single user basis. This is not a comprehensive list of every single permission enabled/disabled on Discord; just the important permissions. Permissions may differ within a Circle's channels; Circle specific permissions aren't listed here.

Notes:

- 1 - Must add themselves to the `Event Manager` role via `/role` commands to be able to Manage Events.

- 2 - Must add themselves to the `Expressions Manager` role via `/role` commands to be able to Manage Expressions.

### Other Roles

**Circle** roles have their own channels and private membership requirements. See `#circle-list` for more.

**Bot** and **3rd Party Bot** (and related) roles are reserved for bots only.

There are other roles that gain access to various server functions such as `Event Manager`.

Roles and their functions can change at any time. Any major changes will be announced to the server.

## Server Bots

Currently, the ricebear@Discord guild has the following bots: 

- HarumiBot, based from [Augeo](https://github.com/fuyubear/augeo), a bot using discord.js v14. This bot has multiple functions; type `/` to see its commands.

For a bot to be eligible to join the server, it must not be MEE6 or a part of [Bot Labs, which is owned by Bluestacks](https://botlabs.gg/). Bots that can be self-hostable and/or open source are a plus. Send bot requests to a server admin.
