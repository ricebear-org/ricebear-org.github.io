## Getting Started

The first step is to join the guild using [this join link](https://discord.gg/BwW9Q25) or use the join code *BwW9Q25*. Upon joining, new users will start at Ring 5 (this doesn't have a dedicated role) unless they have a different Ring status. **There may be times when this guild is closed to new users. This page will update when that happens.** Read over the Guild Rules, either in #rules, or on this page.

### Guild Rules

**Prelude: If a higher level user misuses their powers, please report the incident to fuyubear#0765 on Discord and/or by email to fuyubear+rbdiscord`at`protonmail.com.**

Rule 0: New users starting at Ring 5 must go through a "Gate Entry" process in order to become members of this community. This is done through being promoted through the Ring System. All new users must know that to pass this process, you basically need to introduce yourself and hang out with the community in #public and/or "Ch.0H / Guest Space". After a few days, you should be promoted to Ring 4, gaining access to join more channels. See more at [Server Layout and Channel Visibility](#server-layout-and-channel-visibility).

Rule 1: stay good towards each other. In other words, don't create toxicity, and don't treat others the way you don't want to be treated. Keep in mind that banter towards someone else is okay as long as they are cool with it. If they don't like it, it's considered harassment and is not welcome here.

Rule 2: report any violations to Ring 1/2 users. If there is power abuse, please take it up to fuyubear (contact at the top of this section).

Rule 3: do not break the [Discord's Community Guidelines](https://discordapp.com/guidelines). They apply to ALL Discord guilds, not just ours. The ones we really pay attention to:

- Do not organize, participate in, or encourage harassment of others.

- Do not organize, promote, or coordinate servers around hate speech.

- Do not make threats of violence or threaten to harm others.

- Do not evade user blocks or server bans.

- Do not send others viruses or malware.

- Any NSFW content stays in NSFW channels. Any channels intended for NSFW must be labeled as such.

- You may not sexualize minors (children; people who look like children) in any way. Because we are a global community, illustrated depictions (such as lolicon, shotacon, or cub) are not allowed too.
  
  - NOTE: ALL OF DISCORD'S TEXT CHANNELS ARE SCANNED BY PHOTODNA FOR REAL CP. ALL NON-NSFW TEXT CHANNELS ARE SCANNED BY DISCORD'S MACHINE LEARNING IMAGE SCANNER.

- You may not share sexually explicit content of other people without their consent, or share or promote sharing of non-consensual intimate imagery (also known as revenge porn) in an attempt to shame or degrade someone.

- You may not share content that glorifies or promotes suicide or self-harm, including any encouragement to others to cut themselves, or embrace eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia.

- You may not share images of sadistic gore or animal cruelty.

- You may not use our Discord guild for the organization, promotion, or support of violent extremism.

- You may not sell or facilitate the sales of prohibited or potentially dangerous goods.

- You may not promote, distribute, or provide access to content involving the hacking, cracking, or distribution of pirated software or stolen accounts.

- In general, **you should not promote, encourage or engage in any illegal behavior.** This is very likely to get you kicked off our Discord guild and Discord as a whole, and may get you reported to law enforcement.

### Server Layout and Channel Visibility

There's a handful of channels on our server, with more to come. The server tries to reduce as much channel visibility as you can, so that the channels that you only care about come into view.

Anyone who is new and joins the server is by default a Ring 5 user (role-less). They have access to a tiny subset of channels by default. The structure is as follows:

```markdown
📘 INFO
|
|-----#rules

💬 main-text
|
|-----#public

🎤 Main Voice
|
|-----Ch.0H / Public Space
```

You'll need to be Ring 4 or above to gain access to more channels. Once you reach Ring 4, you'll instantly gain access to more channels. The default visibility and layout is as follows:

```markdown
📘 INFO
|
|-----#rules
|-----#announcements
|-----#org-list

💬 main-text
|
|-----#general
|-----#public
|-----#nsfw

🎤 Main Voice
|
|-----Ch.1H
|-----Ch.2H
|-----Ch.3H
|-----Ch.0H / Public Space
```

You can gain access to more channels through joining organizations (see next section) and Ring System promotions.

### Join Organizations

Once you become Ring 4, you can gain access to more topic-specific channels by joining organizations, which are listed under #org-list, or under the command "r;selfrole list". If the organizationsis joinable, feel free to join it by sending the provided text command in any text channel where Red-v3-ricebear is present in. You can alternatively use [https://roleypoly.com](https://roleypoly.com) and login with your Discord account to manage self roles there.

For example, if you want to join the PC Master Race Organization. Here's what you should do:

1. Check #org-list to see if the organization is joinable.

2. Since the organization is joinable, you can type in the proper selfrole command in any text channel where Red-v3-ricebear is available, which is "r;selfrole add pmr". You can also log into [https://roleypoly.com](https://roleypoly.com) with your Discord account, and toggle the pmr role there.

3. You should now see the #pmr-discuss channel, the only channel associated with the PC Master Race organization. To remove your membership from pmr, you can either use "r;selfrole remove pmr" or toggle the role off on [https://roleypoly.com](https://roleypoly.com)

If you have an idea/request for an organization/channel, send it to fuyubear#0765. However, if the organization/channel requires restrictions on who can join (besides being at least Ring 4, the base restriction on almost every channel), the organization/channel won't be created unless you are an active Supporter. Any idea/request that is a direct result in a rule violation will be rejected, no matter if you are a Supporter or not. See the [ricebear Supporter](#ricebear-supporter) section for more.

### User Roles and Perks

Refer to this link [here](#user-groups-rings-and-perks-1) for more details about User Roles and their perks.

### Recommended Applications/Apps to Install

Ring 1-3 users in this guild have come to a general consensus as to what programs to use for certain inter-user tasks. As a new user, it's highly recommended to install these applications/apps for the best experience.

## Supported Discord Clients

This section might be a bit of a bait, since our guild only supports Discord's official clients (Stable, PTB, and Canary). If you run into any issues with the official clients, be sure to bring it up either through Discord's support team or through the Discord Testers Server (server code is *discord-testers*). If you have issues with unofficial clients (Ripcord, BetterDiscord, BeautifulDiscord, Powercord, etc), you'll be asked to use the official clients instead.

## Moderation Philosophy

Note: Ring 1-2 users are considered mod level users.

As mods, we first take action through peaceful mediation. Only, and only if peaceful mediation repeatily fails, then bans will be used. We will not misuse our kick/ban powers; if we do, then we will be reported to the main dev (fuyubear#0765 on Discord) with our powers revoked for a certain amount of time, or for all eternity.

## Voice Channel Info

Descriptions about each voice channel type at ricebear@Discord. These prefixes apply to voice channels that are in either the Main Voice or the Org Voice categories. This naming scheme may not apply anywhere else.

### Any channel with H suffix

These channels have increased sound quality over Reg. Talk Channels. Extremely weak internet connections may not have a good connection to other services with the use of these channels. These channels may use your ISP's data quota close to (or less than) other competing VoIP services, but these channels still use more data than the Reg. Talk Channels.

The bitrate and codec is 64 kbps Opus 1.3 CBR.

### Any channel with R suffix

These channels are optimized to use less of your ISP's data quota and your bandwidth compared to other competing VoIP services. This bitrate is a sweet spot for balancing bitrate and quality. Extremely weak connections may be able to have a better connection to other services with the use of these channels.

The bitrate and codec is 36 kbps Opus 1.3 CBR.

### Any channel with X suffix

Alternative to the S channels. While Supporters can only see these channels, everyone else can join by being moved into it by a Supporter. These channels are geared for music use and use as much data as an internet radio. Users with extremely weak connections should not use these channels. **Only Discord bot voice output (can use the Opus Music tune) will take advantage of this bitrate, due to the fact that Discord user clients are restricted to the Opus Voice tune.**

The bitrate and codec is 128 kbps Opus 1.3 CBR.

### ~~Any channel with S suffix~~ (not available on Discord)

~~These channels are geared for music use and use as much data as an internet radio. These channels are discouraged to be used for voice chat. Users with extremely weak connections should not use these channels. **Only Discord bot voice output (can use the Opus Music tune) will take advantage of this bitrate, due to the fact that Discord user clients are restricted to the Opus Voice tune.**~~

~~The bitrate and codec is 96 kbps Opus 1.3 CBR.~~

### Any channel with V suffix

These channels can have bitrates modified by their channel owners at any time.

### Any channel with P suffix

These channels are restricted (private). Only allowed users are able to join the channels they are allowed to join. The allowed users are controlled by the Channel Owners in their respective channels. Restricted (private) channel creation is currently exclusive to Supporters.

### Any channel with E suffix

These channels are dedicated to special events in our guild. Some of these channels have allowlists that work like the ones found in the channels with a P suffix.

## User Roles and Perks

### Ring System

In ricebear, each user has a certain Ring (status) level, which ranges from 5 (lowest status) to 1 (highest status). The lower Ring a user is, the higher rank the user is. To advance in the hierarchy, just be active in the community and promotions will follow. In cases of community mergers where ricebear continues to maintain this system, users from their prior community may obtain equivalent Ring status from their prior community status.

The Ring system is built to help users recognize active users. Ring status is retained and recognized throughout all of ricebear.

**Descriptions for each Ring**:

- Ring 5: A non-member of ricebear. Also known as a Guest of ricebear.

- Ring 4: An active prospective member of ricebear. This means that they want to be a member, but they aren't a member yet. With time and love, they will eventually become a member of ricebear.

- Ring 3: A full-fledged active member of ricebear. If a Ring 4 member as well as other higher ranked members feel good about each other, a Ring 4 user can be promoted to a Ring 3 user. Usually, this takes around 3-4 months.

- Ring 2: A widely trusted member of ricebear.

- Ring 1: Members who were present within ricebear's first 5 years of existence.

- Ring 0: Not a proper "Ring", but is used to denote whenever high level admin privileges are used.

### Perk Comparison Table

In this table, ✔ and❌are used to show perks User Roles have and don't have. Any of these perks may be revoked or changed at any time, either in the User Group level (table will be updated in this case) or on a single user basis. This is not a comprehensive list of every single permission enabled/disabled on Discord; just the key permissions. Perks may change within Organization channels; these changes aren't listed here.

Notes:

1 - Ring 5 is restricted to messaging in the #public text channel and the Ch.0H / Guest Space voice channel.

2 - Restricted Mode is when the guild blocks any activity from Ring 5 users and entry to new users.

3 - It's not possible to ban/kick users that have either the same or higher rank than your own rank. This is Discord's native behavior.

4 - This means creating channels without admin permission.

### Other Roles

There are also **self and organization** roles. Organizations with their own role can have dedicated text/voice channels that only their members can join. These roles, listed on #org-list, can be joined by Ring 4 (and above) members through "r;selfrole" commands and [https://roleypoly.com](https://roleypoly.com).

**Bot** and **3rd Party Bot** (and related) roles are reserved for bots only.

Roles and their functions can change at any time. Any major changes will be announced to the guild.

## ricebear Supporter

The ricebear Server (not the same as the Discord guild) used to host our own bots from costs money to run. We host our own instances of bots whenever possible to keep our Discord guild stable and safe. We also want to improve our server's functionality through Discord Boosting. To keep the server online and with enhanced functionality, we rely on monetary donations. Giving a donation to ricebear helps the ricebear Server and our guild continue to thrive and live into the near future, and also grants you special (time-limited) perks within the guild. Contact fuyubear#0765 in the guild for details on how to donate. We appreciate your support!

Supporter benefits and their availability may change at any time, for any reason.

For Tier 1, the following perks will be given, at a rate of 2.50-4.99 USD per month:

- Ability to request **a single** restricted voice/text channel (defined as a channel not joinable by any Ring 4), with a custom name, a choice of bitrate (voice channels only) and a configurable allowlist to pick the users who can access your channel. The maximum bitrate that a restricted voice channel can have is 64 kbps.

- Access to X channels with 128 kbps (can let non-Supporters join by dragging them into the channel).

- Exclusive Supporter Tier 1 role.

- The prestige of giving back to ricebear.

For Tier 2, the following perks will be given, for 5.00-9.99 USD or a Discord boost per month:

- All perks from Tier 1.

- 3 restricted channel limit, upped from 1 from Tier 1.

- Ability to request a restricted organization that would not usually be approved, with a custom SFW name, its own channels, a choice of channel bitrate (voice channels only), and a configurable allowlist. The maximum bitrate that a restricted voice channel can have is 96 kbps (or 128 kbps, if available). Channels from the restricted organization count towards the 3 restricted channel limit.

- Exclusive Supporter Tier 2 role (cannot get Supporter Tier 1 role simultaneously).

For Tier 3, the following perks will be given, for 10.00+ USD or at least 2 Discord boosts per month:

- All perks from Tier 2.

- 5 restricted channel limit, upped from 3 from Tier 2.

- The maximum bitrate that a restricted voice channel can have is the highest bitrate available on the server.

- Exclusive Supporter Tier 3 role (cannot get Supporter Tier 1 and 2 roles simultaneously).

- Highest prestige of giving back to ricebear.

Upon the end of your Supporter period, the Active Supporter role will be replaced by the Past Supporter on your account. Restricted organization text channels will be available through a read-only medium. **All other perks are removed.**

### Restricted Channel/Organization Guide

This functionality requires Supporter Tier 2.

To activate your restricted organization, just simply send the following details to fuyubear#0765:

1. Channel name(s) and purpose(s)

2. Block everyone from being moved out of your restricted voice channel (evaluated on a case by case basis and may not be provided)

3. [Tier 2-3 Only] Organization name and purpose

4. [Tier 2-3 Only] Voice channel bitrates

You can configure users who can join your restricted channels using the `r;cc` commands, and who are in your restricted organization (thus changing access to the restricted organization's channels) with the `r;role` commands (Tier 2-3 Only). Just typing either of those commands will show a prompt for the subcommands that you can use. To change any of the other details you've provided, contact fuyubear#0765.

Your restricted organization will be located either alphabetically with other organizations or within the proper category along with other restricted channels.

Admins can bypass the restricted channel's/organization's allowlist for admin purposes.

## Guild Bots

Currently, the ricebear@Discord gulid has the following bots: 

- Red v3 (known as Red-v3-ricebear). This bot has multiple functions; type "r;help" to see its commands.

- AutoDelete-ricebear. In some text channels, unpinned messages are deleted after a period of time.

- Roleypoly. This is a 3rd-party bot not hosted by ricebear. Along with Red v3, it also manages self roles.

- Mudae/Mudaemaid. This is a 3rd-party bot not hosted by ricebear. Its main function is a gacha game, accessable by members with Mudae Gacha Access.

Before requesting a separate bot to join the guild, try looking for an [equivalent cog on cogboard.red](https://cogboard.red/t/approved-repositories/210).

For a bot to be eligible to join, all of these following requirements must be met to be available on main channels:

- They must have a useful purpose.
- They must be hostable on ricebear Server (in other words, must be self-hostable on a relatively low spec Linux server).
- They must be configurable to not store excessive private data and send anonymized telemetry to a non-ricebear owned server. Having no telemetry is a plus.

For organization channels, the only requirement is to be a useful bot.

Once they are eligible to join, fuyubear#0765 will decide whether or not to add the requested bot in the future.
