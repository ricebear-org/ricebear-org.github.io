## About ricebear

We started in Spring 2014 from two friends in the same class in 8th grade, and eventually expanded to a dozen members. The name comes from half of each of the pair's internet alias': rice from ricebowl, and bear from fuyubear.

Our mission is to help create a place for technology and ACG (anime, comics, and games) fans to hang out and to help each other grow, as well as making a difference for the world. Within our hubs, we foster an environment where we can join up in gaming parties, watch and discuss our favorite shows together, and help each other in academics as well as in our daily lives. Although not all of us are within close proximity of each other, our internet existence lets us thrive together beyond geographic limits. We also aspire to improve the world that we live in, whether it be to make life more easier or more enjoyable, through software and classes. All of these things make up the core of ricebear and its purpose.
