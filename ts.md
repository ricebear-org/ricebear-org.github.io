## Getting Started

Welcome to ricebear at TS3: Final DeluXe Version, or for short, ricebear@TS3_FDX! It's a pleasure to have you here. It's a good chance that this will be your first exposure to TS3, and that's okay!

Before starting, [make sure you join our Discord guild](/discord), since this is where all ricebear members send text messages to each other. Some users also use it for voice chat as well.

Due to the limited space given by TeamSpeak's free license, we can be very selective of who becomes a member of our community. Because of this, you need to wait until you're promoted to Ring 4 by an existing Ring 1-3 user to access more features. To be promoted to Ring 4, a Ring 1-3 user must trust you to let you join the server. Without Ring 4, **you cannot join the server on your own**. In many cases, reaching to Ring 4 requires joining the [Discord guild](/discord) and getting the promotion there.

To start the onboarding process, do the following things:

1. Make sure you have [joined our Discord guild](/discord) and received Ring 4.

2. Download and install the latest TeamSpeak 3 client from https://www.teamspeak.com/downloads

3. Open the TeamSpeak 3 client and follow the setup instructions as you see them. **You don't need a myTeamSpeak account to join our server**, so you can skip that step when you see it.

4. Install the Recommended TS3 Client Style & Icon Pack, DarkenTS, which is a dark theme for TS3: [https://community.teamspeak.com/t/skin-release-darkents-save-the-eyes/1091](https://community.teamspeak.com/t/skin-release-darkents-save-the-eyes/1091)

5. Connect to our server through ts.ricebear.org. Feel free to make a bookmark to make future connections easier.

There is a checkbox/boolean setting found in Tools > Options > Playback called  "Automatic voice volume leveling", also known as Automatic Gain Control (AGC), which may be enabled by default. This setting, when enabled, makes an attempt to create a consistent voice volume across each user you are listening to within non-studio channels. Users who sound loud will be turned down (good), while users who sound quiet will be turned up (loss of quality/fidelity). However, in some cases, some quiet mic sound artifacts may be improperly boosted, resulting in an uncomfortable experience. **You can opt to turn this off, if you like, to prevent this from happening. The result is that you will need to manually adjust individual user volumes (right click on a user, select Change Volume).**

If there are any issues with setup or with the next steps listed above, please reach out to a Ring 1-3 user and they should give you help. Also, please review the User Data Policy located at the bottom of this document. It's important, especially if you're privacy minded.

**You should bookmark or save the URL to this document now so that you can access it outside ricebear@TS3_FDX.**

### About the New TS Client

Users are encouraged to use the new TS client whenever feasible to help test functionality. Keep in mind that some features aren't available to the new TS client yet, so you may need to use the TS3 client to perform certain tasks.

Here is a list of known limitations with the new TS client:

- Can't set contacts unless they have the new client and a myTeamspeak account

- No Server text chat

- There's a handful of display differences for text chat:
  
  - Giphy images added from the emoji button become seen as links from a TS3 client
  
  - Emoji added from the emoji button is seen as its text shorthand from a TS3 client (`:grinning:`instead of proper emoji)
  
  - The TS3 client doesn't support viewing code and spoiler formatted text properly.

- Channel Owners can't edit these Channel Permissions: Join and Subscribe

- Channel Owners can't quick add people into Authorized Users

- No multi-select to mass move clients

- Can't see client list

- Can't set and delete avatar

- Can't set nor view AFK messages

### TS3 Client Version Requirements

Keep in mind that this server usually requires the latest PC version of TS3 (mobile versions are not officially suppported). You'll be prompted by the server to install a new version when the time comes; until you install the new version, you won't be allowed to enter the server.

### Recommended Applications/Apps to Install

Ring 1-3 users on this server have come to a general consensus as to what programs to use for certain inter-user tasks. As a new user, it's highly recommended to install these applications/apps for the best experience.

### User Groups (Rings) and Perks

Refer to this link [here](#user-groups-rings-and-perks-1) for more details about User Groups (Rings) and their perks.

### User Behavior Guidelines

Finally, some simple guidelines. Have fun! Be respectful; don't be a dick. It's worth noting that some users (including you) may have different perspectives and mannerisms, but it's best not to follow through them if they cause issues. If another user is being a dick, feel free to talk to one of the Ring 1-2 staff members. Anyone who is suspected of being a dick may have to go through special (ideally peaceful) counseling. If this fails, further action will be taken.

**If a higher privileged user misuses their powers, please report the incident by email to fuyubear+rbts`at`protonmail.com, or message a member of the ricebear Server Team (fuyubear, ricebowl_j on our Discord).**

We hope that you will love this server as much as we do. Enjoy!

## Active Server Advisories

Active server advisories are posted here to guide users whenever anything associated with the server needs careful user attention. Whenever server advisories are posted, users will be pointed to this section of the document through appropriate contact channels.

Currently, there are two active server advisories.

### 2020-08-25: 8/25-8/27 Limited Access to ricebear@TS3

**ricebear@TS3 will not be usable from 8/25-8/27; in the meantime, feel free to join during the Discord guild's "Discord Nights" by using the voice channels there.** During this period, you won't be able to leave the lobby channel. The restrictions are needed, because Vultr, our server host, will be conducting maintenance within the datacenter our server is in to (hopefully) resolve recent network instability experienced by several users of ricebear@TS3. Sorry for any inconveniences caused from this.

### 2020-08-21: Potential Shutdown of ricebear@TS3

Most of our active TS users have unanimously decided to sunset (shutdown) the TS server by the end of this year (Dec 2020), unless TeamSpeak makes major progress on their new TeamSpeak client. Leading up until that point of time, the server may be downsized to accommodate the new convention of using Discord for a majority of activities, both voice and text.

## Officially Supported TS Clients

When a client is officially supported, that means that functionality is tested to work and technical help is provided to users using the officially supported clients and configurations. 

Our server currently only officially supports the latest PC client version with the DarkenTS style and icon pack, as well as the latest beta of the new TS client. PC clients that are older are blocked from joining the server.

TeaSpeak and official TeamSpeak 3 mobile clients are not officially supported. They are not guaranteed to work with our server.

## Channel Info

Descriptions about each channel category at ricebear@TS3_FDX.

### Lobby

These channels are AFK channels. The AFK Radio acts as a client sound check (**properly mute TS while AFK and/or make sure the client's audio settings do not distort audio**) as well as a special radio for AFK users to listen to.

There is also a second lobby channel for those who don't want to be forced into a Radio channel upon login.

Ch.1L's audio preset is Opus Music Quality 10 (bitrate and codec is 97.2 kbps Opus 1.3 CBR). Ch.2L's audio preset is Opus Talk Quality 1.

### Any channel with H suffix

These channels have increased sound quality over Reg. Talk Channels. Extremely weak internet connections may not have a good connection to multiplayer games with the use of these channels. These channels may use your ISP's data quota close to (or less than) other competing VoIP services, but these channels still use more data than the Reg. Talk Channels.

These channels' audio preset is Opus Voice Quality 10.

The bitrate and codec is 63.1 kbps Opus 1.3 CBR.

There is a Ring 1 voice channel that Ring 1 members can only enter.

### Any channel with R suffix

These channels are optimized to use less of your ISP's data quota and your bandwidth compared to other competing VoIP services. Extremely weak connections may be able to have a better connection to multiplayer games with the use of these channels.

These channels' audio preset is Opus Voice Quality 3.

The bitrate and codec is 34.4 kbps Opus 1.3 CBR.

### Any channel with S suffix

These channels are optimized for music use and use as much data as an internet radio. These channels are discouraged to be used for voice chat. Users with extremely weak connections should not use these channels.

These channels' audio preset is Opus Music Quality 10.

The bitrate and codec is 97.2 kbps Opus 1.3 CBR.

### Any channel with V suffix

These channels can have bitrates modified by their channel owners at any time.

### Any channel with P suffix

These channels are private. Only allowed users are able to join the channels they are allowed to join. The allowed users are controlled by the Channel Owners in their respective channels. Private channel creation is currently exclusive to Supporters. 

### Any channel with E suffix

These channels are dedicated to special events on the server. Some of these channels have allowlists that work like the ones found in the channels with a P suffix.

## User Groups (Rings) and Perks

### Ring System

In ricebear (including this server), each user has a certain Ring (status) level, which ranges from 5 (lowest status) to 1 (highest status). The lower Ring a user is, the higher rank the user is. To advance in the hierarchy, just be active in the community and promotions will follow.

The Ring system is built to help users recognize active users. Ring status is retained and recognized throughout all of ricebear.

**Descriptions for each Ring**:

- Ring 5: A non-member of ricebear. Also known as a Guest of ricebear.

- Ring 4: An active prospective member of ricebear. This means that they want to be a member, but they aren't a member yet. With time and love, they will eventually become a member of ricebear.

- Ring 3: A full-fledged active member of ricebear. If a Ring 4 user as well as other higher ranked users feel good about each other, a Ring 4 user can be promoted to a Ring 3 user. Usually, this takes around 3-4 months.

- Ring 2: A widely trusted member of ricebear.

- Ring 1: Members who were present within ricebear's first 5 years of existence.

- Ring 0: Not a proper "Ring", but is used to denote whenever high level admin privileges are used.

Here's how the user promotion system works:

- Every new user starts at Ring 5. At this level, you cannot enter the TS server without special permission.

- To move to Ring 4, someone from Ring 1-3 must promote you to Ring 4. This gives you access to some of the server functions. Ring 4 is granted usually upon exchanging outside contact info (Discord doesn't count as outside contact info).

- To gain membership to ricebear, you must continue to be active amongst the group. Eventually, you'll be recognized as a proper member and get promoted to Ring 3.

- Most of the time, inactivity may get your User Group membership revoked. When this happens, users may need to follow this system again to regain membership.

### Perk Comparison Table

In this table, ✔ and❌are used to show perks User Groups have and don't have. Any of these perks may be revoked or changed at any time, either in the User Group level (table will be updated in this case) or on a single user basis.

Notes:

1 - Ring 0 is only used by the main dev if it's required. It's rare to see Ring 0.

2 - Restricted Mode is when the server asks for a password for new (Ring 5) users; the intention is to block these users from joining the server.

3 - Ring 3 can only kick Ring 4 users.

4 - Users cannot be moved **from** Lobby 1, but can be moved **to** Lobby 1.

5 - Users cannot message, poke, move, kick, or ban Ring 0 users. This is to discourage the 24/7 usage of Ring 0.

## ricebear Supporter

The TS server costs money to run. To keep the server online, we rely on monetary donations. Giving a donation to the server helps the server continue to thrive and live into the near future, and also grants you special (time-limited) perks within the server. Contact fuyubear on the server for details on how to donate. We appreciate your support!

Supporter benefits and their availability may change at any time, for any reason.

All perks received are optional to use.

For Tier 1, the following perks will be given, at a rate of 2.50-4.99 USD per month:

- Exclusive cosmetic server icon (group) for Supporters.

- The prestige of giving back to the server.

For Tier 2, the following perks will be given, for 5.00-9.99 USD or a Discord boost per month:

- Custom SFW picture avatar of your choice, after approval from a Ring 0 user like fuyubear. This can be changed/deleted at any time during the active Supporter period.

- A verified tag to show proof of yourself (like Twitter). The tag name and active/deactive state can be modified at any time during the active Supporter period.

- Ability to request **1 custom channel** with a custom SFW name and icon, option to hide participants from outsiders, option to have only Authorized Users talk, and an allowlist to pick the users who can join your channel.

- Every other perk from Tier 1.

For Tier 3, the following perks will be given, for 10.00+ USD or at least 2 Discord boosts per month:

- Ability to request **up to 3 custom channels**.

- Can opt custom channels to use the Opus Music codec.

- Every other perk from Tier 1.

After the conclusion of the Supporter period, regardless of tier, the following perks will remain indefinitely:

- The SFW picture avatar attached to the Supporter's identity at the moment the Supporter period ends. This can be self-deleted at any time. No new avatar can be uploaded until you return to be an active Supporter.

- The verified tag (if used) as is, at the moment the Supporter period ends. The tag name cannot be changed until you return to be an active Supporter. You can still ask a Ring 0 to activate/deactivate the tag at any time.

**All other perks not listed in the immediate above bullet list are removed within a day after your active Supporter period ends. A long period of inactivity on the server may result in the removal of these other perks (see the [User Data Policy](#user-data-policy)) unless you reach out to a Ring 0 to reactivate these perks.**

### Avatar Guide

To activate your avatar, send your preferred avatar to fuyubear. Once it's approved, you'll be given a temporary amount of time to upload the avatar. Right click on yourself, and Set Avatar. As soon as the avatar is uploaded, you won't be able to set a new avatar unless you send the new avatar to fuyubear, but you can delete it.

### Custom Channel Guide

To activate your custom channel, just simply send the following details to fuyubear:

1. Channel name, number, and icon (if desired, must be 1:1 ratio)

2. Block everyone from being moved out of your custom channel (evaluated on a case by case basis and may not be provided)

3. [Tier 2 Only] Whether or not to use Opus Music

To change these details, contact fuyubear. For other customizations, follow the details below to apply these changes to your custom channel.

To customize your custom channel, you must be the Channel Owner and inside your custom channel. Then, right click on your channel and click on Edit Channel. The following settings can be changed to customize your channel:

- **DO NOT SET ANY OF THESE VALUES TO VALUES OTHER THAN THE ONES LISTED HERE. FUNCTIONALITY MAY BE BROKEN OTHERWISE.**

- [Standard > Moderation > Needed Talk Power] can be changed to 25 (all users Ring 4 and above can talk) or 50 (only Authorized Users and Channel Owner can talk). 

- [Permissions > Join] can be changed to 25 (all users Ring 4 and above can join) or 50 (only Authorized Users and Channel Owner can join).

- [Permissions > Subscribe] can be changed to 25 (participants are visible outside the channel for Ring 4 and above) or 50 (participants are NOT visible outside the channel).

You can also set Priority Speakers within your custom channel. This means that anyone else who isn't a Priority Speaker will have their volume automatically lowered while a Priority Speaker is talking.

To add users to the Authorized User list:

- Method 1: Add directly from the server tree
  
  1. Join your custom channel.
  
  2. Bring the desired user you want to add into your custom channel.
  
  3. Right click on the desired user. Go to Set Channel Group, and click on Authorized User.

- Method 2: Add directly through the server's Permissions system
  
  1. Go to the top bar, click on Permissions, then Channel Groups.
  
  2. Click on Authorized User on the right.
  
  3. Click on the icon that kinda looks like a person under the left listing pane. The icon is the last icon starting from the left.
  
  4. This opens a new window. Click on your custom channel on the left.
  
  5. Add users to the right pane. You can drag users into the right pane from the server tree, your Contacts List, or the Client List (must be Ring 1 or 2 to see Client List).

A major update to this policy was made in Jul 25, 2020. From this date, more personal data and metadata will be collected to improve the quality of the service. This includes IP addresses and connected/disconnected timestamps.

Last updated: **Jul 25 2020**

**This service primarily serves North American users. While this service is offered in English, it's not allowed to be used by anyone outside North America. If you are a non North American user, please use ricebear@Discord or stop using the service immediately.** 

**A minimal amount of data is collected to maintain a balance between privacy and functionality. Privacy is respected to the fullest extent possible for the service's operation.**

**While measures are taken to secure the server as much as possible, no internet service (including this one) is 100% secure.**

**All data mentioned in this policy can be requested to be seen or removed by reaching the Ring 1-2 (refered to as staff) users within this service. It's free, but please don't ask too often (it's unreasonable anyway). Proof of self must be given to do this; if the proof is insuffient, staff may deny your request. If you are banned from the service, staff may also deny your request.**

**3rd parties are defined as any entity that isn't fuyubear or our hosting staff. If a 3rd party takes over the management of this service (aka a transfer of ownership), this policy may become void.**

**Only data labeled as "Personal Information" can be modified through changing these items within the TeamSpeak app. It can't be done by anyone but the user themselves.**

This service transmits but doesn't store any "communication" data, like text messages and voice conversations. Other users can potentially store these messages and/or conversations themselves; this service has no complete control over this.

This service collects and stores the following "Personal Information" data from you by default:

1. Your nicknames used to connect/disconnect on this service
2. First 28 characters of your TeamSpeak identity string (also called your UID) found within your identity's .ini file (if exported from the TeamSpeak app)
3. Your IP address (IPv4 or IPv6, which was used) when you connect to this service

This service collects and stores the following "Metadata" from you by default:

1. Timestamp of when you joined the service for the first time
2. Timestamps of connecting/disconnecting/timeout on this service
3. The server groups that you are in, as well as Private Channels that you are allowed to join
4. Amount of data that you upload/download with the File Transfer feature within this month
5. Amount of data that you upload/download with the File Transfer feature since when you started using this server

The data above (some of which are considered "Personal Information") is:

1. Stored so that you can use the service to its full extent (like unlocking Regular user privileges and removing data from inactive users)
2. Associated with a single and unique numerical user ID
3. Stored in a MySQL database (file not encrypted, but is protected with the best of our abilities)
4. Located at a US datacenter. Hosting provider and US privacy policies and laws apply.
5. Not shared to any 3rd party without your permission unless required by our hosting provider's rules and/or US law, for the data migration/transfer necessary for service operations, or if the service management is acquired by 3rd parties.
6. Bound by other Privacy Policies from 3rd parties that take over the management of this service in the future. A take over will lead to the termination of this policy.
7. Viewable by any of the Ring 1-2 users at any time while the service is operating
8. Deleted if a user is inactive for over 60 days from their last login, if a user requests their data to be deleted, or if the Ring 1-2 user feels it's necessary to be deleted. This applies to every user, regardless of user group. If you log in after 60 days and find that your group has been revoked, please reach out to the Ring 1-2 staff. You may be able to get your group membership back.

When donating to gain ricebear Supporter, you are bound to any Privacy Policy that applies when using 3rd party entities (payment processor(s)) to donate through.

When a UID is banned, it is only removed if there is an appropriate reason (appeal, end of time limit); else, it remains on the service indefinitely. Nicknames won't be stored in this case.

If there is a substantial breach within the service, efforts from the Ring 1-2 staff will be taken to notify all affected users. Since contact info may not be stored from Ring 5 users, they may not be notified of such events. If you are a Ring 5 user and want to be notified, then you must become a Ring 4 user through establishing communications outside this service with any member of the Ring 1-2 staff. To minimize your impact from any breaches, don't use a nickname that you want to get exposed.

Any major changes here will be shown in the login window popup. Optionally, you can be notified of any major changes by asking the Ring 1-2 staff to notify you within this service.
